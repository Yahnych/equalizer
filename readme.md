### Roadmap

Things that need to be sorted out:

+ Solo specific tracks/channels
+ Playback without audio
+ When loading don't update / append UI (for production)
+ Ability to click and drag a `Equalizer.Timeline.Unit` in order to create a more useful WYSIWYG
+ Equalizer should work without a `Equalizer.Timeline`
+ Build process
+ Tests
