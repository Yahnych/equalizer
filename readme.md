# Equalizer

An audio analysis tool for real-time and choreographed visualizations.

Check out the [gh-pages](https://jonobr1.github.io/equalizer) for use.

### Roadmap

Things that need to be figured out:

+ TODO: Unsure about how many circles are actually being drawn in playback mode past the range
+ Ability to load without update / append UI (for production)
+ Ability to click and drag a `Equalizer.Timeline.Unit` in order to create a more useful WYSIWYG
+ `Equalizer` should work without a `Equalizer.Timeline`
+ `Equalizer.Timeline` should work without `Equalizer`
+ Build process
+ Tests
+ Readme Documentation on how to use all different ways
+ Examples
